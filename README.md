# Campus Navigation System

## Overview
This project is about creating a smart navigation system for a university campus to help users find the shortest or most optimal routes to locations like lecture halls, libraries, cafeterias, and administrative buildings. The system will consider distance, time, and accessibility.

## Key Objectives
1. Campus Map as a Graph: Model the campus layout using a graph where locations are nodes, and paths between them are edges with attributes like distance and time.
2. Pathfinding Algorithms: Implement BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's Algorithm for different types of routes:
    - BFS: Shortest path by the number of stops.
    - DFS: Explore all paths, useful for scenic routes.
    - Dijkstra's: Shortest path based on distance or time.

## Task
1. Graph Construction: Collect data on campus paths and integrate it into a usable format.
2. Implement Algorithms: Code BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's to calculate and display routes.
3. User Interface: Create a simple interface for users to select start and end points, with accessibility features.
